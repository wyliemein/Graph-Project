This is a simple python project that visualizes some of the material that I learned in my Graph Theory
class at UCSC. For functionallity it takes in a list of vertex degrees and tells the user whether that
graph is representable. If it is, it produces an example of how the graph could look (isomorphic) in both
an adjacency matrix as well as using matplotlib. Then it will tell the user the degree sum, number of edges
and Eigen Vector Centrality values of the graph.
